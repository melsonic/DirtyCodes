implement a triangle and perform the following 2D transformation over the triangle 
1 translation
2 scaling
3 shearing
4 reflation
5 rotation


given a square object with coordinate point a(0, 3), b(3, 3) c(3, 0) d(0, 0) and perform the following
(i) scaling with parameter 2 towards x axis and 3 owards y axis
(ii) translation with dis 1 towards x axis and 5 towards y axis
(iii) reflection on x axis
(iv) rotation 90deg antoclockwise
